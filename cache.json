Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion\nplanning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific\nmessages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain,\nwe quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP\nproblems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies\nunderscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the\nsuccess of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical\nmanipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in\nreal-world settings.\n","authors":["Shu Wang","Muzhi Han","Ziyuan Jiao","Zeyu Zhang","Ying Nian Wu","Song-Chun Zhu","Hangxin Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11552v2.pdf","comment":"Submitted to IROS 2024.

One framework here is\nreinforcement learning, where the robot is given a reward function that encodes\nthe task, and the robot autonomously learns actions to maximize its reward.\nExisting approaches to reinforcement learning often frame this problem as a\nMarkov decision process, and learn a policy (or a hierarchy of policies) to\ncomplete the task. These policies reason over hundreds of fine-grained actions\nthat the robot arm needs to take: e.g., moving slightly to the right or\nrotating the end-effector a few degrees. But the manipulation tasks that we\nwant robots to perform can often be broken down into a small number of\nhigh-level motions: e.g., reaching an object or turning a handle. In this paper\nwe therefore propose a waypoint-based approach for model-free reinforcement\nlearning. Instead of learning a low-level policy, the robot now learns a\ntrajectory of waypoints, and then interpolates between those waypoints using\nexisting controllers. Our key novelty is framing this waypoint-based setting as\na sequence of multi-armed bandits: each bandit problem corresponds to one\nwaypoint along the robot's motion. We theoretically show that an ideal solution\nto this reformulation has lower regret bounds than standard frameworks. We also\nintroduce an approximate posterior sampling solution that builds the robot's\nmotion one waypoint at a time.

This paper proposes a method to remedy this\nprocess by considering hardware-level reusability, using\nLearning-from-observation (LfO) paradigm with a pre-designed skill-agent\nlibrary. The LfO framework represents the required actions in\nhardware-independent representations, referred to as task models, from\nobserving human demonstrations, capturing the necessary parameters for the\ninteraction between the environment and the robot. When executing the desired\nactions from the task models, a set of skill agents is employed to convert the\nrepresentations into robot commands. This paper focuses on the latter part of\nthe LfO framework, utilizing the set to generate robot actions from the task\nmodels, and explores a hardware-independent design approach for these skill\nagents. These skill agents are described in a hardware-independent manner,\nconsidering the relative relationship between the robot's hand position and the\nenvironment. As a result, it is possible to execute these actions on robots\nwith different hardware configurations by simply swapping the inverse\nkinematics solver.

One\noption is the depth-first strategy, a simple backtracking strategy that\ntraverses the search space in the order in which successor nodes are generated.\nAn alternative is the best-first strategy, which was designed to make it\npossible to use domain-specific heuristic information. By exploring promising\nparts of the search space first, best-first algorithms are usually more\nefficient than depth-first algorithms.\n  In programs that play minimax games such as chess and checkers, the\nefficiency of the search is of crucial importance. Given the success of\nbest-first algorithms in other domains, one would expect them to be used for\nminimax games too. However, all high-performance game-playing programs are\nbased on a depth-first algorithm.\n  This study takes a closer look at a depth-first algorithm, AB, and a\nbest-first algorithm, SSS. The prevailing opinion on these algorithms is that\nSSS offers the potential for a more efficient search, but that its complicated\nformulation and exponential memory requirements render it impractical. The\ntheoretical part of this work shows that there is a surprisingly\nstraightforward link between the two algorithms -- for all practical purposes,\nSSS is a special case of AB.

The YOLOv5 series is\ncurrently one of the most advanced and widely used methods for object\ndetection.

To address these concerns,\nthis paper presents an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 technique customized for\nmobile devices, specifically intended for identifying objects associated with\ntransmission lines. The C3Ghost module is integrated into the convolutional\nnetwork of YOLOv5 to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in the\nfeature channel fusion process and improve feature expression performance. In\naddition, a FasterNet module is introduced to replace the c3 module in the\nYOLOv5 Backbone. The FasterNet module uses Partial Convolutions to process only\na portion of the input channels, improving feature extraction efficiency and\nreducing computational overhead. To address the imbalance between simple and\nchallenging samples in the dataset and the diversity of aspect ratios of\nbounding boxes, the wIoU v3 LOSS is adopted as the loss function. To validate\nthe performance of the proposed approach, Experiments are conducted on a custom\ndataset of transmission line poles.

However,\ntraditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,\nsuch as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research\naddresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called\nIrregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular\nrepetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:\nInter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle\nConsistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of\ncycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval\ninconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle\nsegments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To\nencapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes\nconsistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss\n(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence\namong cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of\ncycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the\nRepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in\nVAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional\nadaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming\nexisting models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the\nneed for dataset-specific optimization.

This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning.

Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior.

In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline\nReinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to\nRL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different\noffline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four\ntasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the\nexisting offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack.

To examine these differences, we develop an\nevaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various\nsettings (omniscient, non-omniscient).

Such subgroups\nare typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased\nsubgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further\nimproving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an\nimplicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup,\nwhich does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.\n  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM),\na novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of\ndiscovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach\ndecomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple\nsubgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction\nmethod, Partial Least Square (PLS), guided by useful supervision from the image\nclassifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup\ncomponent by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language\nfoundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups\nsimultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased\nsubgroups.

This study\nanalyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands\nto explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV\ngrowth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective\nability to provide congestion management services according to the\nspecifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a\ndata-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications\nof delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation\nlevels and types of service. The probability of offering specific grid services\nby different categories of charging stations (CS) is analysed. These\nprobabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make\ninformed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant\nregulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. The\nability to offer different flexibility products, namely re-dispatch and\ncapacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed using various\ndispatch strategies. Next, machine learning models are used to predict the\nprobability of CSs being able to deliver these products, accounting for\nuncertainties. Results indicate that residential charging locations have\nsignificant potential to provide both products during evening peak hours. While\nshared EVs offer better certainty regarding arrival and departure times, their\nsmall fleet size currently restricts their ability to meet the minimum order\nsize of flexible products.\n","authors":["Nanda Kishor Panda","Simon H.

Human corrective feedback is a\ncrucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to\nand learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only\ndo robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right\ninformation in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they\nwould need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections\nabout high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill\nparameters.

One natural\nsolution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner\nwhere each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and\npreviously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They\ndominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training\nMLPs compared to autoregressive networks.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion\nforecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized\nattention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and\ndifferent position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding\nthe transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while\nadopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the\naforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets.

The redundant DOF offers greater\nmanipulability of the arm configuration to avoid obstacles and singularities,\nbut it must be parameterized to fully specify the joint angles for a given end\neffector pose. For 7-DOF revolute (7R) manipulators, we introduce a new concept\nof generalized shoulder-elbow-wrist (SEW) angle, a generalization of the\nconventional SEW angle but with an arbitrary choice of the reference direction\nfunction. The SEW angle is widely used and easy for human operators to\nvisualize as a rotation of the elbow about the shoulder-wrist line. Since other\nredundancy parameterizations including the conventional SEW angle encounter an\nalgorithmic singularity along a line in the workspace, we introduce a special\nchoice of the reference direction function called the stereographic SEW angle\nwhich has a singularity only along a half-line, which can be placed out of\nreach.

As such, we present\nGelLink, a compact, underactuated, linkage-driven robotic finger with low-cost,\nhigh-resolution vision-based tactile sensing and proprioceptive sensing\ncapabilities. In order to reduce the amount of embedded hardware, i.e. the\ncameras and motors, we optimize the linkage transmission with a planar linkage\nmechanism simulator and develop a planar reflection simulator to simplify the\ntactile sensing hardware.

Differentiable simulation promises faster convergence and more\nstable training by computing low-variant first-order gradients using the robot\nmodel, but so far, its use for legged robot control has remained limited to\nsimulation. The main challenge with differentiable simulation lies in the\ncomplex optimization landscape of robotic tasks due to discontinuities in\ncontact-rich environments, e.g., quadruped locomotion. This work proposes a\nnew, differentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges.

Recently, efforts have been made to train\nlanguage agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and\naction trajectories as the training data.

In this work, we propose\nA$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent\nTrajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting\nagent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly\nsampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent\nwith the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then\nsynthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled\naction. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for\nthe failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed\ntrajectory for contrastive self-training.

In this setting,\ncross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model\ntrained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when\napplied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a\nsimple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this\ndrop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to\ndisregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's\nperformance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending\nmany KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks\ncan be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the\ncross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional\ncost.

To provide conceptual and analytical\ninsights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the\ndistillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral\nregularisation component.

In the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), learning\ncoordinated and decentralized policies that are sensitive to risk is\nchallenging. To formulate the coordination requirements in risk-sensitive MARL,\nwe introduce the Risk-sensitive Individual-Global-Max (RIGM) principle as a\ngeneralization of the Individual-Global-Max (IGM) and Distributional IGM (DIGM)\nprinciples. This principle requires that the collection of risk-sensitive\naction selections of each agent should be equivalent to the risk-sensitive\naction selection of the central policy.

The currently prevalent\noptimization objective for GCL is InfoNCE. Typically, it employs augmentation\ntechniques to obtain two views, where a node in one view acts as the anchor,\nthe corresponding node in the other view serves as the positive sample, and all\nother nodes are regarded as negative samples. The goal is to minimize the\ndistance between the anchor node and positive samples and maximize the distance\nto negative samples. However, due to the lack of label information during\ntraining, InfoNCE inevitably treats samples from the same class as negative\nsamples, leading to the issue of false negative samples. This can impair the\nlearned node representations and subsequently hinder performance in downstream\ntasks. While numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of\nfalse negatives, they still face various challenges. For instance, while\nincreasing the number of negative samples can dilute the impact of false\nnegatives, it concurrently increases computational burden. Thus, we propose\nGraphRank, a simple yet efficient graph contrastive learning method that\naddresses the problem of false negative samples by redefining the concept of\nnegative samples to a certain extent, thereby avoiding the issue of false\nnegative samples.

As it requires impacting a\npossibly large set of degrees of freedom composing the environment, mutual\ninformation maximization fails alone in producing useful and safe manipulation\nbehaviors. Furthermore, tackling this by augmenting skill discovery rewards\nwith additional rewards through a naive combination might fail to produce\ndesired behaviors. To address this limitation, we introduce SLIM, a\nmulti-critic learning approach for skill discovery with a particular focus on\nrobotic manipulation. Our main insight is that utilizing multiple critics in an\nactor-critic framework to gracefully combine multiple reward functions leads to\na significant improvement in latent-variable skill discovery for robotic\nmanipulation while overcoming possible interference occurring among rewards\nwhich hinders convergence to useful skills. Furthermore, in the context of\ntabletop manipulation, we demonstrate the applicability of our novel skill\ndiscovery approach to acquire safe and efficient motor primitives in a\nhierarchical reinforcement learning fashion and leverage them through planning,\nsignificantly surpassing baseline approaches for skill discovery.\n","authors":["David Emukpere","Bingbing Wu","Julien Perez","Jean-Michel Renders"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00823v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at IEEE ICRA 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00862v2","updated":"2024-03-21T10:14:09Z","published":"2024-02-29T21:05:14Z","title":"NewsBench: Systematic Evaluation of LLMs for Writing Proficiency and\n  Safety Adherence in Chinese Journalistic Editorial Applications","summary":"  This study presents NewsBench, a novel benchmark framework developed to\nevaluate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Chinese Journalistic\nWriting Proficiency (JWP) and their Safety Adherence (SA), addressing the gap\nbetween journalistic ethics and the risks associated with AI utilization.\nComprising 1,267 tasks across 5 editorial applications, 7 aspects (including\nsafety and journalistic writing with 4 detailed facets), and spanning 24 news\ntopics domains, NewsBench employs two GPT-4 based automatic evaluation\nprotocols validated by human assessment.

This objective aims to preserve the\nrepresentations of certain selected vectors while memorizing the\nrepresentations of new factual information. Specifically, ROME optimizes this\nobjective using an equality constraint, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible\nleast-square constraint. In addition to making batched edits, MEMIT also edits\nthe model at multiple layers.

However, most models often\nsuffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation, which cannot jointly utilize\nall modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the\nworse learnt modality, but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained\nobservation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support.\nHence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained\ncooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios\nwhere the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this\nend, we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the\ncontribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation, we\nobserve that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level,\nbeyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze\nthis issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by\nenhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a\ntargeted manner.

For instance, OpenAI devoted\nsix months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a\nmajor challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on\nevaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and\nregulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key\ndimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The\nsurvey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,\nsafety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence\nto social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into\nseveral sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.\nAdditionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further\ninvestigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and\nconducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,\nin general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall\ntrustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the\ndifferent trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance\nof conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous\nimprovements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM\ntrustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to\npractitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be\ncrucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various\napplications.\n","authors":["Yang Liu","Yuanshun Yao","Jean-Francois Ton","Xiaoying Zhang","Ruocheng Guo","Hao Cheng","Yegor Klochkov","Muhammad Faaiz Taufiq","Hang Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05374v2.pdf","comment":"Fixed several typos"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14049v1","updated":"2024-03-21T00:14:53Z","published":"2024-03-21T00:14:53Z","title":"A Roadmap Towards Automated and Regulated Robotic Systems","summary":"  The rapid development of generative technology opens up possibility for\nhigher level of automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) embodiment in\nrobotic systems is imminent.

This\nposes challenges to regulations in safety-demanding applications such as\nmedical scenes. We argue that the unregulated generative processes from AI is\nfitted for low level end tasks, but intervention in the form of manual or\nautomated regulation should happen post-workflow-generation and\npre-robotic-execution. To address this, we propose a roadmap that can lead to\nfully automated and regulated robotic systems. In this paradigm, the high level\npolicies are generated as structured graph data, enabling regulatory oversight\nand reusability, while the code base for lower level tasks is generated by\ngenerative models.

Differentiable simulation promises faster convergence and more\nstable training by computing low-variant first-order gradients using the robot\nmodel, but so far, its use for legged robot control has remained limited to\nsimulation. The main challenge with differentiable simulation lies in the\ncomplex optimization landscape of robotic tasks due to discontinuities in\ncontact-rich environments, e.g., quadruped locomotion. This work proposes a\nnew, differentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges. The key\nidea involves decoupling the complex whole-body simulation, which may exhibit\ndiscontinuities due to contact, into two separate continuous domains.\nSubsequently, we align the robot state resulting from the simplified model with\na more precise, non-differentiable simulator to maintain sufficient simulation\naccuracy. Our framework enables learning quadruped walking in minutes using a\nsingle simulated robot without any parallelization. When augmented with GPU\nparallelization, our approach allows the quadruped robot to master diverse\nlocomotion skills, including trot, pace, bound, and gallop, on challenging\nterrains in minutes. Additionally, our policy achieves robust locomotion\nperformance in the real world zero-shot.

Recently, situated temporal planning was\nintroduced, where planning starts at time 0 and execution occurs after planning\nterminates. Situated temporal planning reflects a more realistic scenario where\ntime passes during planning. However, in situated temporal planning a complete\nplan must be generated before any action is executed. In some problems with\ntime pressure, timing is too tight to complete planning before the first action\nmust be executed.

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks.

Recent LMMs incorporate more\ncomplex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which\nincrease the number of visual tokens significantly.

The classification process is iterative, and in each step an\nobject in a certain class undergoes an action attached to that class,\ninitiating the transition of the object to one of the classes. The sequence of\ntransitions, which we call class transitions, must be designed to provide the\nfinal assignment of objects to the target class. The transition process can be\ndescribed in the form of a directed graph, and the success of the final\nclassification is mainly due to the properties of this graph. In our previous\nresearch we showed that the desirable structure of the transition graph is an\noriented rooted tree with orientation towards the root vertex, which\ncorresponds to the normal class. It is clear that the transition graph of an\narbitrary algorithm (policy) may not have this property.

Inspired by\nmasked image modeling in computer vision, recent works first patchify and\npartially mask out time series, and then train Transformers to capture the\ndependencies between patches by predicting masked patches from unmasked\npatches. However, we argue that capturing such patch dependencies might not be\nan optimal strategy for time series representation learning; rather, learning\nto embed patches independently results in better time series representations.\nSpecifically, we propose to use 1) the simple patch reconstruction task, which\nautoencode each patch without looking at other patches, and 2) the simple\npatch-wise MLP that embeds each patch independently. In addition, we introduce\ncomplementary contrastive learning to hierarchically capture adjacent time\nseries information efficiently.

To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple\nyet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series.

In this paper, we propose MM-Diff, a unified and\ntuning-free image personalization framework capable of generating high-fidelity\nimages of both single and multiple subjects in seconds. Specifically, to\nsimultaneously enhance text consistency and subject fidelity, MM-Diff employs a\nvision encoder to transform the input image into CLS and patch embeddings. CLS\nembeddings are used on the one hand to augment the text embeddings, and on the\nother hand together with patch embeddings to derive a small number of\ndetail-rich subject embeddings, both of which are efficiently integrated into\nthe diffusion model through the well-designed multimodal cross-attention\nmechanism.

While numerous online users actively participate in the combat\nagainst misinformation, many of such responses can be characterized by the lack\nof politeness and supporting facts. As a solution, text generation approaches\nare proposed to automatically produce counter-misinformation responses.\nNevertheless, existing methods are often trained end-to-end without leveraging\nexternal knowledge, resulting in subpar text quality and excessively repetitive\nresponses. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented response generation\nfor online misinformation (RARG), which collects supporting evidence from\nscientific sources and generates counter-misinformation responses based on the\nevidences. In particular, our RARG consists of two stages: (1) evidence\ncollection, where we design a retrieval pipeline to retrieve and rerank\nevidence documents using a database comprising over 1M academic articles; (2)\nresponse generation, in which we align large language models (LLMs) to generate\nevidence-based responses via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\nWe propose a reward function to maximize the utilization of the retrieved\nevidence while maintaining the quality of the generated text, which yields\npolite and factual responses that clearly refutes misinformation.

However, current techniques\nfor evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive\nlabels.\n  $\\textbf{Methods}$: We use a \"Masked Siamese Network\" (MSN) to identify novel\nphenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained\nto predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test\nMSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen\ntechniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes\nfrom Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict\nperformance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from\nboth countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.\n  $\\textbf{Results}$: MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to\nIsrael whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| > 496, p <\n10^-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99%\naccuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite\nbeing trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to\nnoisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel\nand out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively).

To address this issue, we introduce\nDistributional Opponent-aided Multi-agent Actor-Critic (DOMAC), the first\nspeculative opponent modelling algorithm that relies solely on local\ninformation (i.e., the controlled agent's observations, actions, and rewards).\nSpecifically, the actor maintains a speculated belief about the opponents using\nthe tailored speculative opponent models that predict the opponents' actions\nusing only local information. Moreover, DOMAC features distributional critic\nmodels that estimate the return distribution of the actor's policy, yielding a\nmore fine-grained assessment of the actor's quality. This thus more effectively\nguides the training of the speculative opponent models that the actor depends\nupon. Furthermore, we formally derive a policy gradient theorem with the\nproposed opponent models.

When\nthe system evolves on a Lie group and the system is invariant under left (or\nright) translations, Lie-Poisson reduction can be applied to eliminate half of\nthe dimensions (and returning the dimension of the problem to the back to the\noriginal number).\n  Hybrid control systems are an extension of (continuous) control systems by\nallowing for sudden changes to the state.

One of the\nchallenges is the lack of a simulation environment that will represent the\nactual plant as accurately as possible to train DRL policies. Stochasticity and\nnon-linearity of wastewater treatment data lead to unstable and incorrect\npredictions of models over long time horizons. One possible reason for the\nmodels' incorrect simulation behavior can be related to the issue of\ncompounding error, which is the accumulation of errors throughout the\nsimulation. The compounding error occurs because the model utilizes its\npredictions as inputs at each time step. The error between the actual data and\nthe prediction accumulates as the simulation continues.

Errors in assembly can lead to\nsignificant consequences such as extended surgery times, and prolonged\nmanufacturing or maintenance times in industry. Assembly scenarios can benefit\nfrom in-situ AR visualization to provide guidance, reduce assembly times and\nminimize errors. To enable in-situ visualization 6D pose estimation can be\nleveraged. Existing 6D pose estimation techniques primarily focus on individual\nobjects and static captures. However, assembly scenarios have various dynamics\nincluding occlusion during assembly and dynamics in the assembly objects\nappearance. Existing work, combining object detection/6D pose estimation and\nassembly state detection focuses either on pure deep learning-based approaches,\nor limit the assembly state detection to building blocks. To address the\nchallenges of 6D pose estimation in combination with assembly state detection,\nour approach ASDF builds upon the strengths of YOLOv8, a real-time capable\nobject detection framework. We extend this framework, refine the object pose\nand fuse pose knowledge with network-detected pose information. Utilizing our\nlate fusion in our Pose2State module results in refined 6D pose estimation and\nassembly state detection. By combining both pose and state information, our\nPose2State module predicts the final assembly state with precision. Our\nevaluation on our ASDF dataset shows that our Pose2State module leads to an\nimproved assembly state detection and that the improvement of the assembly\nstate further leads to a more robust 6D pose estimation.

Such temporal constraints are crucial for temporal\nplanning, reasoning, and the exact timing for the execution of bimanual actions\non a bimanual robot. In our previous work, we addressed the learning of\ntemporal task constraints on the symbolic level and demonstrated how a robot\ncan leverage this knowledge to respond to failures during execution.

That is\nessential for applications that require precise pose information, such as\nhuman-computer interaction, scene understanding, and rehabilitation training.\nDue to the challenges in data collection, mainstream datasets of 3D human pose\nestimation are primarily composed of multi-view video data collected in\nlaboratory environments, which contains rich spatial-temporal correlation\ninformation besides the image frame content. Given the remarkable\nself-attention mechanism of transformers, capable of capturing the\nspatial-temporal correlation from multi-view video datasets, we propose a\nmulti-stage framework for 3D sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) human pose\ndetection. Firstly, the spatial module represents the human pose feature by\nintra-image content, while the frame-image relation module extracts temporal\nrelationships and 3D spatial positional relationship features between the\nmulti-perspective images. Secondly, the self-attention mechanism is adopted to\neliminate the interference from non-human body parts and reduce computing\nresources. Our method is evaluated on Human3.6M, a popular 3D human pose\ndetection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

One of the most common\ncharacteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by\na binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that\ncaptures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count\nscenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival\nfollows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson\ndistribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to\nthe non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e.,\n$X\\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately,\nin this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is\nidentifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to\n$Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed\npath to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching\nStructure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using\nhigh-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the\npath and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained\nfrom the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable\nunder some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal\nstructure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","authors":["Jie Qiao","Yu Xiang","Zhengming Chen","Ruichu Cai","Zhifeng Hao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16523v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by AAAI-2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16512v1","updated":"2024-03-25T07:55:29Z","published":"2024-03-25T07:55:29Z","title":"LLMs Are Few-Shot In-Context Low-Resource Language Learners","summary":"  In-context learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to perform\ndiverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context\ninformation, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between\nhigh-resource and low-resource languages.

However, due to\nstructural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic\nflow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and\nperiodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the\nkey temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a\ncompact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN\n(Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively\nconsidering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow.\nFirst, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked\nsubseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context\nin a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and\ncontextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series.\nThen, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by\nusing stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are\nextracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making\ntime-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn\nfine-grained short-term temporal features.

In this work, we aim to analyze the\nlimitations of using LLMs in constructing user simulators for CRS, to guide\nfuture research. To achieve this goal, we conduct analytical validation on the\nnotable work, iEvaLM. Through multiple experiments on two widely-used datasets\nin the field of conversational recommendation, we highlight several issues with\nthe current evaluation methods for user simulators based on LLMs: (1) Data\nleakage, which occurs in conversational history and the user simulator's\nreplies, results in inflated evaluation results.

Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their\nimpact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important\nissue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to\nthe internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that\nneed access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that\nthe output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text.\nTherefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal\ntext, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose\nto perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts\nsome linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a\nconcurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection\nmechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs\nin which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has\nbeen evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the\nOPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of\nlinguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$.

Although data are not transmitted, edge devices have to deal with limited\ncommunication bandwidths, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects due to the\nlimited computational resources of users' devices. A prominent approach to\novercome such difficulties is FedADMM, which is based on the classical\ntwo-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The\ncommon assumption of FL algorithms, including FedADMM, is that they learn a\nglobal model using data only on the users' side and not on the edge server.\nHowever, in edge learning, the server is expected to be near the base station\nand have direct access to rich datasets. In this paper, we argue that\nleveraging the rich data on the edge server is much more beneficial than\nutilizing only user datasets. Specifically, we show that the mere application\nof FL with an additional virtual user node representing the data on the edge\nserver is inefficient.

Agents can share their learning experience with\ntheir peers by taking actions observable to them, with values from a finite\nfeasible set of states. Actions can be interpreted as samples from the beliefs\nwhich agents may form and update on what the true state of the world is.\nSharing samples, in place of full beliefs, is motivated by the limited\ncommunication, cognitive, and information-processing resources available to\nagents especially in large populations.

Agents have incomplete, noisy, and heterogeneous sources of\ninformation, providing them with recurring private observations of the\nunderlying state of the world. Agents can share their learning experience with\ntheir peers by taking actions observable to them, with values from a finite\nfeasible set of states. Actions can be interpreted as samples from the beliefs\nwhich agents may form and update on what the true state of the world is.\nSharing samples, in place of full beliefs, is motivated by the limited\ncommunication, cognitive, and information-processing resources available to\nagents especially in large populations. Previous work (Salhab et al.) poses the\nquestion as to whether learning with probability one is still achievable if\nagents are only allowed to communicate samples from their beliefs.

For example, if some\nunsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned\non these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations,\ni.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the\ncredibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw\nCivil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that\ncan be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and\ndifficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic\nframework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors,\nand evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data,\nspecifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With\nthe framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets\nconstructed from the above benchmarks.

However, large datasets pose storage\nchallenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during\ntraining without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to\nthese limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into\na condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.\nOne crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking\nthe original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if\nthe employed model architecture differs from the model used during\ndistillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,\ne.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation\nwith Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with\ndataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel\ndiffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the\ngradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of\ndiffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several\nImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256). As a\nresult, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation techniques\nby up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively.\n","authors":["Brian B.

The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects\nthe subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by\nthe candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal\nrecommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions\nmakes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive\ninteraction process. We further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction\ngeneration mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of\ntypical real-world recommendation scenarios. In summary, the MovieLens platform\ndemonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to\naddress cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation\naccuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in\npractice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the\ncontexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user\nknowledge about the item collections. While results on MovieLens can be useful\nas a reference, they should not be solely relied upon as the primary\njustification for the effectiveness of a recommendation system model.\n","authors":["Yu-chen Fan","Yitong Ji","Jie Zhang","Aixin Sun"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09985v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16190v1","updated":"2024-03-24T15:14:44Z","published":"2024-03-24T15:14:44Z","title":"Logic-based Explanations for Linear Support Vector Classifiers with\n  Reject Option","summary":"  Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a well-known Machine Learning (ML) model\nfor linear classification problems.

Logic Code Simulation with LLMs","summary":"  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant\npotential in addressing logic problems. capitalizing on the great capabilities\nof LLMs for code-related activities, several frameworks leveraging logical\nsolvers for logic reasoning have been proposed recently. While existing\nresearch predominantly focuses on viewing LLMs as natural language logic\nsolvers or translators, their roles as logic code interpreters and executors\nhave received limited attention. This study delves into a novel aspect, namely\nlogic code simulation, which forces LLMs to emulate logical solvers in\npredicting the results of logical programs. To further investigate this novel\ntask, we formulate our three research questions: Can LLMs efficiently simulate\nthe outputs of logic codes? What strength arises along with logic code\nsimulation? And what pitfalls? To address these inquiries, we curate three\nnovel datasets tailored for the logic code simulation task and undertake\nthorough experiments to establish the baseline performance of LLMs in code\nsimulation. Subsequently, we introduce a pioneering LLM-based code simulation\ntechnique, Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL).

To\nminimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image\npre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained\nmodels is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel\nframework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable\nparameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its\nparameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks,\nwhich consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The\nPoint-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we\npropose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize\na parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware\nAdapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to\ncapture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions.\nExtensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better\nperformance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using\nonly 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our approach.

Yet, deploying RL policies in\nreal-world scenarios presents the crucial challenge of ensuring safety.\nTraditional safe RL approaches have predominantly focused on incorporating\npredefined safety constraints into the policy learning process. However, this\nreliance on predefined safety constraints poses limitations in dynamic and\nunpredictable real-world settings where such constraints may not be available\nor sufficiently adaptable. Bridging this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nconcurrently learns a safe RL control policy and identifies the unknown safety\nconstraint parameters of a given environment. Initializing with a parametric\nsignal temporal logic (pSTL) safety specification and a small initial labeled\ndataset, we frame the problem as a bilevel optimization task, intricately\nintegrating constrained policy optimization, using a Lagrangian-variant of the\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, with Bayesian\noptimization for optimizing parameters for the given pSTL safety specification.\nThrough experimentation in comprehensive case studies, we validate the efficacy\nof this approach across varying forms of environmental constraints,\nconsistently yielding safe RL policies with high returns. Furthermore, our\nfindings indicate successful learning of STL safety constraint parameters,\nexhibiting a high degree of conformity with true environmental safety\nconstraints.

In this field, generalization is a\nlong-standing challenge, either to out-of-distribution scenes or from Sim to\nReal. In this paper, we propose NaVid, a video-based large vision language\nmodel (VLM), to mitigate such a generalization gap. NaVid makes the first\nendeavour to showcase the capability of VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art level\nnavigation performance without any maps, odometer and depth inputs. Following\nhuman instruction, NaVid only requires an on-the-fly video stream from a\nmonocular RGB camera equipped on the robot to output the next-step action. Our\nformulation mimics how humans navigate and naturally gets rid of the problems\nintroduced by odometer noises, and the Sim2Real gaps from map or depth inputs.\nMoreover, our video-based approach can effectively encode the historical\nobservations of robots as spatio-temporal contexts for decision-making and\ninstruction following. We train NaVid with 550k navigation samples collected\nfrom VLN-CE trajectories, including action-planning and instruction-reasoning\nsamples, along with 665k large-scale web data. Extensive experiments show that\nNaVid achieves SOTA performance in simulation environments and the real world,\ndemonstrating superior cross-dataset and Sim2Real transfer.

Conversely, data-driven\napproaches can improve pathfinding efficiency but require extensive data\nlabeling and lack theoretical guarantees, making it challenging for practical\napplications. To combine the strengths of the two methods, we utilize the\nimperative learning (IL) strategy and propose a novel self-supervised\npathfinding framework, termed imperative learning-based A$^*$ (iA$^*$).\nSpecifically, iA$^*$ is a bilevel optimization process where the lower-level\noptimization is dedicated to finding the optimal path by a differentiable A$^*$\nsearch module, and the upper-level optimization narrows down the search space\nto improve efficiency via setting suitable initial values from a data-driven\nmodel. Besides, the model within the upper-level optimization is a fully\nconvolutional network, trained by the calculated loss in the lower-level\noptimization.

We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies\nspecific task objectives, expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic\n(DT-STL). One advantage for reformulation of a task via formal frameworks, like\nDT-STL, is that it permits quantitative satisfaction semantics. In other words,\ngiven a trajectory and a DT-STL formula, we can compute the robustness, which\ncan be interpreted as an approximate signed distance between the trajectory and\nthe set of trajectories satisfying the formula. We utilize feedback\ncontrollers, and we assume a feed forward neural network for learning these\nfeedback controllers. We show how this learning problem is similar to training\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is\nproportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses\na challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and\nna\\\"{i}ve gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task\nobjectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of dropout\nor gradient sampling. We show that, the existing smooth semantics for\nrobustness are inefficient regarding gradient computation when the\nspecification becomes complex. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nsmooth semantics for DT-STL that under-approximates the robustness value and\nscales well for backpropagation over a complex specification.

Existing methods\nhave applied SAM to surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) by tuning SAM-based\nframeworks with surgical data.

To address these\nproblems, in this paper, we investigate text promptable SIS and propose\nSurgicalPart-SAM (SP-SAM), a novel SAM efficient-tuning approach that\nexplicitly integrates instrument structure knowledge with SAM's generic\nknowledge, guided by expert knowledge on instrument part compositions.\nSpecifically, we achieve this by proposing (1) Collaborative Prompts that\ndescribe instrument structures via collaborating category-level and part-level\ntexts; (2) Cross-Modal Prompt Encoder that encodes text prompts jointly with\nvisual embeddings into discriminative part-level representations; and (3)\nPart-to-Whole Adaptive Fusion and Hierarchical Decoding that adaptively fuse\nthe part-level representations into a whole for accurate instrument\nsegmentation in surgical scenarios.

In this paper, we consider the SGD algorithm that employ\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator to compute the gradient, called\nMCMC-SGD. Since MCMC reduces the sampling complexity significantly, it is an\nasymptotically convergent biased estimator in practice. Moreover, by\nincorporating a general class of unbounded functions, it is much more difficult\nto analyze the MCMC sampling error. Therefore, we assume that the function is\nsub-exponential and use the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov\nchains to derive error bounds of the MCMC estimator.

This study\npresents a data-driven framework to optimize capacity management decisions\nwithin hospital systems during surge events. Two key decisions are optimized\nover a tactical planning horizon: allocating dedicated capacity to surge\npatients and transferring incoming patients between emergency departments (EDs)\nof hospitals to better distribute demand.

We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies\nspecific task objectives, expressed in discrete-time Signal Temporal Logic\n(DT-STL). One advantage for reformulation of a task via formal frameworks, like\nDT-STL, is that it permits quantitative satisfaction semantics. In other words,\ngiven a trajectory and a DT-STL formula, we can compute the robustness, which\ncan be interpreted as an approximate signed distance between the trajectory and\nthe set of trajectories satisfying the formula. We utilize feedback\ncontrollers, and we assume a feed forward neural network for learning these\nfeedback controllers. We show how this learning problem is similar to training\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is\nproportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses\na challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and\nna\\\"{i}ve gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task\nobjectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of dropout\nor gradient sampling.

Second, we propose a compact\nrepresentation that tightly couples hand and object poses. Third, we propose\ntwo different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:\ngrasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose.

These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the\nsetting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss\nminimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the\ncriteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we\npresent a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted\nChebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect\nto several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can\nidentify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its\ncomplexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems\nare then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of\npopular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,\nwhile efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the\n(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a\nparticular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a\nvery large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks.

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance.

However, the success of data-driven vision and language models is\ncostly or even infeasible to be reproduced for rare modalities. In this paper,\nwe present ViT-Lens-2 that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation\nlearning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them\nto a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens is tuned to\nproject any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space, which are then\nprocessed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded\nrepresentations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space,\npre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens-2 provides a unified\nsolution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two\nappealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to\nnovel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent\ndownstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters.\nWe tailor ViT-Lens-2 to learn representations for 3D point cloud, depth, audio,\ntactile and EEG, and set new state-of-the-art results across various\nunderstanding tasks, such as zero-shot classification.

With the proposed AV2AV, two key\nadvantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with\nindividuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary\nlanguages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely\ntranslates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates\nbetween audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience\nby presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2)\nWe can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By\nemploying the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can\neffectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise,\nshowcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a\nparallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language\ntranslation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A.

Experimental studies on\ndifferent test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive\nperformance with widely used MOEAs. It is also promising to see the operator\nonly learned from a few instances can have robust generalization performance on\nunseen problems with quite different patterns and settings.

Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle).

This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

How to debunk rumors as early as possible remains a\nchallenging problem. Existing studies mainly leverage information propagation\nstructure to detect rumors, while very few works focus on correlation among\nusers that they may coordinate to spread rumors in order to gain large\npopularity. In this paper, we propose a new detection model, that jointly\nlearns both the representations of user correlation and information propagation\nto detect rumors on social media. Specifically, we leverage graph neural\nnetworks to learn the representations of user correlation from a bipartite\ngraph that describes the correlations between users and source tweets, and the\nrepresentations of information propagation with a tree structure. Then we\ncombine the learned representations from these two modules to classify the\nrumors. Since malicious users intend to subvert our model after deployment, we\nfurther develop a greedy attack scheme to analyze the cost of three adversarial\nattacks: graph attack, comment attack, and joint attack. Evaluation results on\ntwo public datasets illustrate that the proposed MODEL outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art rumor detection models. We also demonstrate our method\nperforms well for early rumor detection. Moreover, the proposed detection\nmethod is more robust to adversarial attacks compared to the best existing\nmethod.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

The standard object-detection methods cannot identify unknown objects\nthat are not included under predefined categories. This is because\nobject-detection methods are trained to assign a background label to pixels\ncorresponding to the presence of unknown objects. To address this problem, the\npixel-wise anomaly-detection approach has attracted increased research\nattention. Anomaly-detection techniques, such as uncertainty estimation and\nperceptual difference from reconstructed images, make it possible to identify\npixels of unknown objects as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, when\napplied to images with many unknowns and complex components, such as driving\nscenes, these methods often exhibit unstable performance. The purpose of this\nstudy is to achieve stable performance for detecting unknown objects by\nincorporating the object-detection fashions into the pixel-wise anomaly\ndetection methods. To achieve this goal, we adopt a semantic-segmentation\nnetwork with a sigmoid head that simultaneously provides pixel-wise anomaly\nscores and objectness scores. Our experimental results show that the objectness\nscores play an important role in improving the detection performance. Based on\nthese results, we propose a novel anomaly score by integrating these two\nscores, which we term as unknown objectness score.

To solve image\nrestoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by\nincorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling\nprocess of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a\nchallenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large\ncomputational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present\nadditional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the\nnumber of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling\nsteps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration\nsolver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the\ndata consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a\nreconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that\nenforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates\nversatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent\nspace. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps\nthrough the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is\nvalidated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration\ntasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.\n","authors":["Xiang Li","Soo Min Kwon","Ismail R.

Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve\nnot only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,\nsuch as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.\nHowever, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large\nvolume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited\ncontact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via\non-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still\nface three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory\ncapabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness.

To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical\natherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A\ndeep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the\nAI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%\ninternal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median\nage 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed\ntomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3\nmonths.

The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC\nmodel assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.\nOverall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.\nAUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation\ncohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a\nstandard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of\nthe Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0\nestimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented\nin the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully\nselected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available\nWFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance\nusing data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using\nweather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous\nmodels is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in\nthe following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)\nestimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,\nusing the FAO56-PM method.

In this paper, we propose an interpretable\nand generalizable visual planning framework consisting of i) a novel\nSubstitution-based Concept Learner (SCL) that abstracts visual inputs into\ndisentangled concept representations, ii) symbol abstraction and reasoning that\nperforms task planning via the self-learned symbols, and iii) a Visual Causal\nTransition model (ViCT) that grounds visual causal transitions to semantically\nsimilar real-world actions. Given an initial state, we perform goal-conditioned\nvisual planning with a symbolic reasoning method fueled by the learned\nrepresentations and causal transitions to reach the goal state.

In this study, we find that the intermediate layers of models\ncan encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors\nperform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost\nlayers. We further probe models regarding local semantic representations\nthrough object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may\nexcessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to\nencode global information.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning\nin stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a\npartially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals.\nSpecifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in\nLinear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially\nordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal\ngoals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred\npolicy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated\nprobability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most\npreferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to\nillustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing\ndetailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.\n","authors":["Hazhar Rahmani","Abhishek N.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide\nmultiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory\ncost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to\nfind a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint\nviolation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood.

Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates.

An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling.
